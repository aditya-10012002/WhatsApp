# WhatsApp
A functional clone of the original WhatsApp application.
Language used - Java in Android Studio.
Google FireBase used as database to store all the chats, images and other stuff from the users.
Currently the Calls function of this App doesn't work because of the paid plans.
Do download and test it. Believe me its fun :)
